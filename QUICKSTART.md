# Web3 Gaming: Quickstart Checklist

## âš¡ Day 1: Setup & First Connection (4 hours)

- [ ] **Install Unity** (2020.3 LTS or newer)
- [ ] **Clone Unity MCP repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp.git
  ```
- [ ] **Install UV package manager**
  ```bash
  # Windows
  powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  # Mac
  brew install uv
  ```
- [ ] **Install dependencies**
  ```bash
  uv pip install -e .
  ```
- [ ] **Configure Claude's settings** (if using AI assistance)
  - Navigate to Settings > Developer > Unity MCP
- [ ] **Create new Unity project**
- [ ] **Import Web3.unity SDK** from the Asset Store
- [ ] **Add wallet connection code** (see README.md)
- [ ] **Test wallet connection** with MetaMask

## ðŸ”„ Day 2: Chain Selection (4 hours)

- [ ] **Create network selection UI**
  - Simple dropdown with supported chains
- [ ] **Implement chain switching logic**
- [ ] **Setup contract addresses** for each supported chain
- [ ] **Test chain switching** in the Unity editor

## ðŸ§  Day 3: Smart Contract Setup (4 hours)

- [ ] **Create or import existing smart contracts**
- [ ] **Deploy contracts to testnets**
  - Polygon Mumbai
  - Avalanche Fuji
  - Ethereum Goerli/Sepolia
- [ ] **Save contract addresses and ABIs**
- [ ] **Implement contract interface** in Unity

## ðŸŽ® Day 4: In-Game Integration (8 hours)

- [ ] **Display player's wallet address** in UI
- [ ] **Show player's owned assets** from contract
- [ ] **Create asset interaction mechanics**
- [ ] **Implement transaction signing flow**

## ðŸ§ª Day 5: Testing & Optimization (8 hours)

- [ ] **Test on multiple chains**
- [ ] **Optimize gas usage**
- [ ] **Implement caching for blockchain data**
- [ ] **Reduce loading times**
- [ ] **Create error handling for failed transactions**

## ðŸš€ Day 6: Polishing & Launch Prep (8 hours)

- [ ] **Create onboarding tutorial** for new Web3 users
- [ ] **Implement analytics** to track usage
- [ ] **Complete security review**
- [ ] **Prepare mainnet deployment**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Gas Price Volatility**: Don't hardcode gas prices; use estimates
2. **Transaction Timing**: Add proper loading states while waiting for transactions
3. **Chain ID Confusion**: Verify chain IDs before sending transactions
4. **Asset Metadata**: Cache metadata to avoid repeated IPFS/HTTP requests
5. **Private Key Security**: Never store private keys in your game

## Required Tools

- Unity 2020.3+ 
- Web3.unity SDK or ThirdWeb SDK
- MetaMask (for testing)
- Remix or Hardhat (for contract development)
- Etherscan/PolygonScan (for verification)

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Wallet Connection Time**: Should be under 3 seconds
- **Chain Switching**: Should be under 5 seconds
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Show pending state after 2 seconds
- **Asset Loading**: Should load thumbnails in under 5 seconds

Remember: A working demo with basic functionality is worth more than a perfect plan. Get the minimal viable product working first, then iterate.
