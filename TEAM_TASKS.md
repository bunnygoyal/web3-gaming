  - Add error handling and user feedback systems

- [ ] **Afternoon (4 hours):**
  - Build gameplay mechanics that utilize blockchain assets
  - Create onboarding flow for new users
  - Polish user experience
  - Implement asset metadata display

### Blockchain Specialist Tasks (Day 2)
- [ ] **Morning (4 hours):**
  - Implement asset minting functionality
  - Create chain-switching logic
  - Build player inventory fetching system
  - Test multi-chain support

- [ ] **Afternoon (4 hours):**
  - Implement transaction signing and broadcasting
  - Create caching system for blockchain data
  - Set up asset ownership verification
  - Connect all blockchain functions to UI hooks

### End of Day 2 Integration (2 hours together)
- Connect all blockchain functions with game mechanics
- Test complete flow across multiple chains
- Fix critical bugs and integration issues

## Day 3: Finalization & Deployment

### Game Developer Tasks (Day 3)
- [ ] **Morning (4 hours):**
  - Final UI polish
  - Optimize asset loading
  - Create help/tutorial system
  - Conduct usability testing

- [ ] **Afternoon (4 hours):**
  - Fix any gameplay issues
  - Optimize performance
  - Prepare build settings for deployment
  - Create final build

### Blockchain Specialist Tasks (Day 3)
- [ ] **Morning (4 hours):**
  - Deploy final contracts to mainnet
  - Optimize gas usage
  - Verify contracts on blockchain explorers
  - Set up contract monitoring system

- [ ] **Afternoon (4 hours):**
  - Conduct security audit
  - Test mainnet connections
  - Create automated testing scripts
  - Document blockchain architecture

### End of Day 3 (2 hours together)
- Final integration testing
- Deploy to target platform
- Verify all systems working in production environment

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Clear Communication:**
   - Use a shared Discord/Slack channel for real-time communication
   - 3 scheduled check-ins per day (morning, midday, evening)
   - Shared documentation for handoffs
   
2. **Focused Responsibilities:**
   - Game developer doesn't need to understand blockchain details
   - Blockchain specialist doesn't need to worry about game mechanics
   - Each specialist works independently on their domain
   
3. **Integration Points:**
   - Well-defined APIs between game and blockchain systems
   - Clear documentation of expected inputs/outputs
   - Regular integration tests
   
4. **Shortcuts to Take:**
   - Use pre-built UI components from the Asset Store
   - Leverage ThirdWeb prefabs for wallet connections
   - Use Claude to generate boilerplate code
   - Start with existing smart contract templates
   - Focus on functionality first, optimization later

5. **Don't Waste Time On:**
   - Custom wallet implementations (use existing solutions)
   - Over-engineering the contract architecture
   - Complex game mechanics (keep it simple)
   - Detailed documentation (focus on working code)
   - Perfect UI (functional is good enough)

## Key Technical Requirements

- Game must interact with assets on Polygon, Ethereum, and Avalanche
- Players must be able to connect their wallets and view owned assets
- Game should display owned NFTs and allow interaction with them
- Chain switching should be seamless with proper error handling
- Asset metadata should be cached to minimize blockchain queries

This compressed timeline is ambitious but achievable with focused effort and parallel development. The key is to maintain clear communication between team members and focus on critical functionality.
