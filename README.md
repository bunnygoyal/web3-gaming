## Fast-Track Blockchain Integration: 2-3 Days to Launch

Everyone's overthinking blockchain integration. They're writing thousand-page whitepapers while the real players are shipping products. You don't need to become a blockchain expert. You need to execute.

## Team Structure

This repo is organized for a two-person team working in parallel:
- **Person 1: Game Developer** - Focuses on Unity development and game mechanics
- **Person 2: Blockchain Specialist** - Handles all on-chain integrations

For detailed day-by-day tasks for each team member, see [TEAM_TASKS.md](TEAM_TASKS.md).

## Key Files in This Repository
- [TEAM_TASKS.md](TEAM_TASKS.md) - Parallel implementation plan for 2-3 day completion
- [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Technical details and code examples
- [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) - Checklist of tasks with estimated completion times

## Immediate Action Steps

1. Set up these three tools. No debating, no researching alternatives - these work:
   - Unity MCP - So Claude can write code for you
   - Web3.unity SDK from ChainSafe - For the blockchain connectivity
   - UV package manager - Essential for the installation process

2. Run these exact commands:
```bash
# Clone the Unity MCP repository
git clone https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp.git

# Install UV package manager (Windows)
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
# OR for Mac
# brew install uv

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

3. Verify the setup through Unity's Window menu:
   - Select "Unity MCP > Configurator"
   - Click "Auto Configure"
   - In Claude: Navigate to Settings > Developer > Unity MCP

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### For Game Developer
```csharp
// Simple example for displaying an NFT in your game
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class NFTDisplay : MonoBehaviour
{
    public RawImage imageComponent;
    public Text nameText;
    public Text descriptionText;
    
    public async Task DisplayNFT(string tokenURI)
    {
        // Parse JSON metadata from tokenURI
        // Load texture from image URL
        // Apply to UI components
    }
}
```

### For Blockchain Specialist
```csharp
// Basic wallet connection
using UnityEngine;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Web3Unity.Scripts.Library.Ethers.Providers;

public class WalletConnector : MonoBehaviour
{
    public async Task<bool> ConnectWallet()
    {
        var response = await Web3Wallet.Connect();
        
        if (response != null)
        {
            Debug.Log("Connected wallet address: " + response.address);
            PlayerPrefs.SetString("WalletAddress", response.address);
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Development Philosophy

Most developers waste weeks learning blockchain theory. Winners execute the setup in one afternoon and start building immediately. The difference between success and failure isn't understanding every blockchain conceptâ€”it's implementing the first functional prototype while everyone else is still reading documentation.

**Don't come back until you have a working wallet connection in your game. Not slides about it. Not plans for it. The actual working feature.**
