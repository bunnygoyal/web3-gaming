# Web3 Gaming Implementation Guide

## The No-Nonsense Approach to Blockchain Game Development

Everyone's overthinking blockchain integration. They're writing thousand-page whitepapers while the real players are shipping products. You don't need to become a blockchain expert. You need to execute.

## Immediate Action Steps

1. Set up these three tools. No debating, no researching alternatives - these work:
   - Unity MCP - So Claude can write code for you
   - Web3.unity SDK from ChainSafe - For the blockchain connectivity
   - UV package manager - Essential for the installation process

2. Run these exact commands:
```bash
# Clone the Unity MCP repository
git clone https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp.git

# Install UV package manager (Windows)
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
# OR for Mac
# brew install uv

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

3. Verify the setup through Unity's Window menu:
   - Select "Unity MCP > Configurator"
   - Click "Auto Configure"
   - In Claude: Navigate to Settings > Developer > Unity MCP

## Implementation Priorities

### 1. Wallet Connection (Day 1-2)
Start with this - implement a basic wallet connection using the Connect Wallet prefab from your chosen SDK. This is your foundation.

```csharp
// Basic wallet connection example
using Thirdweb;

public class WalletManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private ThirdwebSDK sdk;
    
    async void Start()
    {
        sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("polygon");
        await sdk.wallet.Connect();
    }
}
```

### 2. Chain Selection (Day 3-4)
Add a simple UI for players to select different blockchains:

```csharp
// Chain switching functionality
public class BlockchainManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private ThirdwebSDK sdk;
    
    public async void SwitchToPolygon()
    {
        sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("polygon");
        await InitializeContracts();
    }
    
    public async void SwitchToAvalanche()
    {
        sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("avalanche");
        await InitializeContracts();
    }
    
    private async Task InitializeContracts()
    {
        // Initialize your game contracts
    }
}
```

### 3. Smart Contract Deployment (Day 5-7)
Deploy basic asset contracts to test networks:

```csharp
// Interacting with deployed contracts
public async Task MintGameAsset()
{
    var contract = sdk.GetContract("YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS");
    await contract.ERC721.Mint(new NFTMetadata
    {
        name = "Game Asset",
        description = "In-game item",
        image = "https://example.com/asset.png"
    });
}
```

## Development Philosophy

Most developers waste weeks learning blockchain theory. Winners execute the setup in one afternoon and start building immediately. The difference between success and failure isn't understanding every blockchain conceptâ€”it's implementing the first functional prototype while everyone else is still reading documentation.

**Don't come back until you have a working wallet connection in your game. Not slides about it. Not plans for it. The actual working feature.**
