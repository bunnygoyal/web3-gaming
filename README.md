## Fast-Track Blockchain Integration: 2-3 Days to Launch

Everyone's overthinking blockchain integration. They're writing thousand-page whitepapers while the real players are shipping products. You don't need to become a blockchain expert. You need to execute.

## Team Structure

This repo is organized for a two-person team working in parallel:
- **Person 1: Game Developer** - Focuses on Unity development and game mechanics
- **Person 2: Blockchain Specialist** - Handles all on-chain integrations

## Individual Task Lists

Each team member has their own dedicated task list with specific responsibilities:

- [Game Developer Tasks](TASKS_GAME_DEVELOPER.md) - UI development, asset visualization, game mechanics
- [Blockchain Specialist Tasks](TASKS_BLOCKCHAIN_SPECIALIST.md) - Wallet connection, blockchain integration, smart contracts

## Tools You'll Need

### For Game Developer
- Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer (URP compatible)
- Unity MCP for AI assistance
- Basic UI assets (from Asset Store)

### For Blockchain Specialist
- One of these SDKs:
  - Web3.unity by ChainSafe
  - ThirdWeb Unity SDK 
  - Moralis Unity SDK
- Smart contract development tools (Remix, Hardhat, etc.)
- Test accounts on multiple chains

## Immediate Action Steps

1. **Setup Unity MCP** - For AI-assisted development with Claude:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp.git
   
   # Install UV package manager (Windows)
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   # OR for Mac
   # brew install uv
   
   # Install dependencies
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Unity Setup** - Verify the MCP setup:
   - In Unity: Window > Unity MCP > Configurator > Auto Configure
   - In Claude: Settings > Developer > Unity MCP

3. **Optional: Setup Bankless Onchain MCP** - For blockchain data access:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @bankless/onchain-mcp
   npx @bankless/onchain-mcp
   ```

## Development Philosophy

Most developers waste weeks learning blockchain theory. Winners execute the setup in one afternoon and start building immediately. The difference between success and failure isn't understanding every blockchain conceptâ€”it's implementing the first functional prototype while everyone else is still reading documentation.

**Don't come back until you have a working wallet connection in your game. Not slides about it. Not plans for it. The actual working feature.**
